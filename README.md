# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project demonstrates how to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The objective is to classify the sentiment of given text as **positive** or **negative** using a machine learning model.

> ðŸ”§ This task was completed as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**.
